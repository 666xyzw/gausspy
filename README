This program can generate gaussian input files from spinput, xyz, and gjf files,
and/or can analyze the tar/tgz files from the calculations, by searching for error termination, imaginary frequencies
and samples the optimization energies to a separate file named 'enrgies.csv'. It does not have fancy graphical user interface
so you can run it on a server too ;).

The script uses the Xvibs software written by Bradly A. Smith and modified by Kun Attila-Zsolt.
The src/ folder contains the source files for the Xvibs software.

The program comes with NO WARRANTY!

How to use the program? 

Well...:

########################
On GNU/Linux system(s) #
########################


1. Open a terminal (usually Ctrl + Alt + T).

2. Go in to the gausspy folder and run setup.sh (ex.: ./setup.sh)

	->this script creates the symbolic links needed for the gausspy tool.
	->if the setup prints a message like "mkdir: cannot create directory 'bin/': File exists." it means
	that you already have a bin folder and it didn`t overwrite it;  
	->if the setup prints a message like "ln: failed to create symbolic link '/home/username/bin/xvibs(gausspy)': File
	exists" it means that the files are already present in the bin folder. If you want to update dose files first 
	delete them and run the script angain.

3. Type in gausspy (it will display some messages...don`t worry about them...)

4. A Menu with 5 choices will appear:
	1. Input file manipualtion 
		-> this gets you to the part where you can generate inputfile from xyz/spinpu/gjf files created with Jmol, 
		Hyperchem...etc.
		
		-> The first thing you have to give to the program is the path to the directory where the *.xyz files
		are located
		-ex.: ~/Programing/python/test/
		**.The source files extension is handled automatically by gausspy.
		
		-> Second request is to enter the files route section, ex.: #P B3LYP/6-31G(d) Opt Freq=noraman
		*In a gaussian input file the first line is the route section where you can specify 
		the functionals/basis sets, optimization, frequency calculation...and so on...
		
		-> Third request is to give the charge and spin multiplicity, ex.: 0 1 -> by the way, this is the
		default setting.
		If you don`t eneter anything then this will be written in the file.
		-> Fourth request is the extension of the new file(s), ex.: com -> this is also the default value.
		
		
	2. Data analysis
		-> 'Enter the full path to the directory where you have the tgz/tar files: '
		-> Here you have to enter the path to the folder where you have the tar/tgz files.
		-> ex.: ~/Programing/python/test/;
		-> When you get promted to enter the route section, charge and spin, extension then basically you 
		must do the same thing as above at the input file generation section :) . Theese request pop up only
		when the program has found imaginary frequency(ies) and needs to generate a new set of coordinates.

	3. Readme
		-> prints out this file
	
	4. LICENSE
		-> prints out the license file
	
	5. Exit
		-> Terminates the software.

 *The program is not fully compatible with Windows OS. BUT if you have Windows 10 then you should look up this 
  link: https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/ where it is 
  explained how to install Bash under Windows and from there on you can run this script within that linux environment 
  and it will work!
