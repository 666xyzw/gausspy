This script can generate gaussian input files from spinput, xyz, and gjf files,
and/or can analise the tar/tgz files from the calculations, by searching for error termination, imaginary frequencies
and samples the optimization energies to a separate file named 'enrgies.csv'. It does not have fancy graphical user interface
so you can run it on a server too ;).

How to use the script? 

Well...:

########################
On GNU/Linux system(s) #
########################


1. Open a terminal (usually Ctrl + Alt + T).

2. Go in to the gausspy folder and run setup.sh (ex.: ./setup.sh)

	->this script creates the symbolic links needed for the gausspy tool.
	->if the setup prints a message like "mkdir: cannot create directory 'bin/': File exists." it means
	that you already have a bin folder and it didn`t overwrite it;  
	->if the setup prints a message like "ln: failed to create symbolic link '/home/username/bin/xvibs(gausspy)': File exists" it means that the files 
	are already present in the bin folder. If you want to update dose files first delete them and run the script angain.

3. Type in gausspy (it will display some messages...don`t worry about them...)

4. A Menu with 5 choices will appear:
	1. Input file manipualtion 
		-> this gets you to the part where you can generate inputfile from xyz files created with jmol, Hyperchem...etc.
		-> The first thing you have to give to the program is the path to the directory where the *.xyz files are located
		-> Second request is to eneter the files route section, this means that if your moleculs contain transitional
		metal atoms from the second row or higher then you only have to write 'Pseudo=read Opt' and whaterver you want 
		to calculate. If the molecule has only first row transitional metal atoms then you shoul only write 
		
		
	A)The 'input' or 'input generation' option will generate input files from spinput, xyz and/or gjf files
	B)'analysis' or 'data analysis' will unpack the tar files to a 'tmp' folder and will search for errors, 
	imaginary frequencies and samples the energies to a separate file.

A):
	A1.'Enter the full path to the directory where you have the files: '
		-Here you have to enter the path to the folder where the files are located.
		-ex.: ~/Programing/python/test/
		**.The source files extension is handled automatically by gausspy.

	A2.'Please enter the route section of the new input file(s): '
		-In a gaussian input file the first line is the route section where you can specify 
		the functionals/basis sets, optimization, frequency calculation...and so on...
		-ex.: #P B3LYP/6-31G(d) Opt Freq scf=maxcycle=500

	A3.'Please enter the molecules charge and spin [ex.: 0 1 ]: '
		-Next you have to enter your molecules charge (this is the first number), and 
		it spin multiplicity (the second number) with space between them.
		-ex.: 0 1

	A4.'Please enter the genereated files extension [ex: com]: '
		-The last step is to tell the script what extension will have the new files.
		-ex.: com or gaussian (I gave theese two examples because theese are the most used extensions)

B):
	B1.'Enter the full path to the directory where you have the tgz/tar files: '
		-Here you have to enter the path to the folder where you have the tar/tgz files.
		-ex.: ~/Programing/python/test/;
		-Press enter and the script will begin to work.
		-If the program found imaginary frequency(ies) then you will be promted to enter the route section, 
		charge/spin multiplicity and the extension of the new input files. (These step are A2, A3, A4)
	
	B2., B3., B4. are basically the same as above A2., A3., and A4.

	B5.'Do you need the *.log and the old *.xyz files? [yes/no]: '
		-This is the last step. If you type 'yes', then the program will leave behind the generated *.xyz, *.xyz-, *.ginp files alongside the input files.
		-If you type 'no', then itt will delete all the *.log, *.xyz, *.xyz- and *.ginp files leaving just the input files in the imag folder.

	*The program is not fully compatible with Windows OS. BUT if you have Windows 10 then you should look
	up this link: https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/ where it is explained
	how to install Bash under Windows and from there on you can run this script within that linux environment and it will work!
